#
# A Python package is a way of organizing and structuring Python code.
# It allows you to break down a large programming task into smaller,
# more manageable subtasks or modules.
# Packages are structured using “dotted module names” and can contain submodules.
# They help facilitate modular programming and make it easier to find,
# install, and share software developed by the Python community.
